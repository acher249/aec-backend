# aec-backend

Node express SMTP Server Application

This is the backend to the AEC Hackathon project - [STROLL](https://github.com/Brandoncyu/aec-backend). This allows you to send emails of your spoken notes when you take your walk. You will need to run this at the same time as running the main Stroll front end applicaiton for the SMTP email functionality to work.

To run, type the following command:

```
npm run dev
```
